# Short Version

This short version omits many details, but if you are already familiar with the process of deploying applications, you may be able to use this.

Note that you may need to modify:
* `happycows` to `happycows-qa` or `happycows-cgaucho` (where `cgaucho` is your github id)
* `https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows` to `https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f25/proj-happycows-f24-17` or whatever your repo's url is
* `main` to `my-branch-name` for your feature branch
* `yourEmail@ucsb.edu` to your own email
* values for `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` etc from [Google](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows/blob/main/docs/oauth.md) or [Github](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows/blob/main/docs/github-app-setup-dokku.md) as appropriate
